## Syllabus
The module Mathematics 1 consists of two classes:

### Analysis
The aim of the course is to repeat and deepen selected chapters of Mathematical Analysis. After the participation in the course, the students are able to apply basic methods of analysis, which are important for the acquisition, evaluation and representation of geodata.

### Geometry
After participating in this course, students are able to use the trigonometric functions in different constellations to solve problems in geodesy. Furthermore, students are able to parameterize curves in space and curved surfaces in space in order to derive their properties such as tangents, lengths or curvature dimensions.
