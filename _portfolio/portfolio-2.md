The aim of the AI4Sentinels project is the development of innovative approaches for the processing of Earth observation data 
from the Copernicus satellite missions Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for large-scale mapping and monitoring applications.
In particular, the potential of combining data fusion and domain-specific deep learning approaches will be explored. 
Specifically, the project will develop software solutions for the conversion of Sentinel-1 SAR images into artificial optical 
images and the computational removal of clouds from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images. The resulting novel data products will 
help end users to implement tasks of continuous monitoring or step-by-step change detection in a more flexible and robust manner, mitigating potential without data loss.
