The scientific goal of the SAROPT project is to investigate a stereogrammetric fusion of optical and SAR remote sensing data for the reconstruction of 3D information in urban areas. In this context, the main focus of this project is the investigation of deep learning techniques for the mapping of SAR and optical image data, since the image mapping process is the core challenge of SAR optical stereo analysis. The result of the research project will contribute to a most flexible analysis of heterogeneous satellite image data, especially with respect to fast 3D mapping in time-critical applications.
