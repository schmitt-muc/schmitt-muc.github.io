### 27.06.2019
Our research proposal „AI4Sentinels – Deep Learning for the Enrichment of Sentinel Satellite Images“ was accepted and will be funded by the German Federal Ministry for Econimic Affairs and Energy for three years, starting from 1 August 2019. In the project, we will develop image-to-image translation algorithms based on deep learning and SAR-optical data fusion, which mitigate the cloud cover problem in Sentinel-2 images.

Today, Hossein Bagheri defended his PhD thesis on „Fusion of Multi-sensor-derived Data for the 3D Reconstruction of Urban Scenes “ successfully. He was the first PhD student I have supervised from start to end, and it was my first time serving as reviewer in a PhD examination comittee.

SEN12MS is now officially out! While our dataset, which is currently the largest available curated dataset for the development of machine learning and data fusion techniques in the remote sensing context, has already been out in the form of a pre-print since June 2019, today it was finally officially released through my oral presentation at the Munich Remote Sensing Symposium (MRSS).
