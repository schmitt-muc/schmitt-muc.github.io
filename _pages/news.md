### 28.10.2020
Today, our paper on "Detection of Undocumented Building Constructions from Official Geodata Using a Convolutional Neural Network" has been published in MDPI's Remote Sensing journal as part of the Special Issue Optical Remote Sensing Applications in Urban Areas. It's a very nice demonstration of applied deep learning in remote sensing for a real-world task. Check out the paper here: [Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/21/3537)

### 07.10.2020
SEN12MS has won the Open Data Impact Award by the Stifterverband, a German industry-sponsored organisation that seeks to address challenges in higher education, science and research! I am deeply honored and highly appreciate that an Earth observation dataset made the race. The prize money will be used to further work on EO datasets with a focus on Sentinel data, deep learning, and data fusion. More information about the award can be found on the homepage of the [innOsci initiative of the Stifterverband](https://www.stifterverband.org/innosci/open-data-impact-award).

### 02.10.2020
Another paper on cloud removal from optical satellite images has been published online ("early access") today. This time, it's based on a CycleGAN architecture. And the best thing is, it comes with the open access multi-sensor cloud removal dataset SEN12MS-CR, which is now finally out.   
Check out the paper here: [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9211498)   
Download the dataset here: [SEN12MS-CR dataset](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1459253?show_id=1554803)

### 24.09.2020
I have accepted the invitation to join the Editorial Board of [Frontiers in Remote Sensing](Deep Learning for Matching High-Resolution SAR and Optical Imagery) as an Associate Editor for the area Data Fusion and Assimilation. Let's see where this goes - the open review concept they have is certainly interesting!

### 23.09.2020
It's finally published (in ISPRS Journal) and paginated: Lloyd Hughes' "opus magnum", redefining the state-of-the-art in SAR-optical image matching. If you're interested in this topic, which is highly relevant for image co-registration, stereogrammetry etc., check out the paper here: [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271620302598)

### 01.09.2020
From this day on I am part of the Department of Geoinformatics of the Munich University of Applied Sciences as a full professor for applied geodesy and remote sensing. I am very happy and proud that I have received this chance and will do my best to hold up to expectations. My main task will be teaching remote sensing-related and basic classes (e.g. Mathematics). Besides, I will now finally start my own research group on remote sensing, Earth observation, data fusion and machine learning applied to these fields. Really looking forward to this! 

### 24.08.2020
Today, Lloyd Hughes defended his PhD thesis on "Deep Learning for Matching High-Resolution SAR and Optical Imagery". He is the first PhD candidate for whom I served as main supervisor and first examiner. Thus, his great and innovative contribution to this non-trival problem makes me particularly proud. Congratulations, Dr. Hughes! 

### 27.07.2020
Today, Chunping Qiu defended her PhD thesis on „Deep Learning for Multi-Scale Mapping of Urban Land Cover from Space“ - and as her daily supervisor, I was part of the examination comittee. Chunping really did an awesome job, has published numerous papers and contributed to a big leap forward in urban mapping with modern remote sensing data and deep learning-based anylsis techniques. Congratulations, Dr. Qiu!

### 02.07.2020
I am extremely happy to finally announce the publication of our pioneering paper on cloud-removal from Sentinel-2 imagery, called "Cloud removal in Sentinel-2 imagery using a deep residual neural network and SAR-optical data fusion". Very unfortunately, the journal publication process consumed quite some time, so that other groups have published similar approaches in the meantime. The uniqueness of our work is that we have trained and tested on globally sampled data with spatially completely disjunct training and test sets. So, if you're interested in a study paving the way for a generically applicable method for the declouding of Sentinel-2 imagery, check out the paper here: [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271620301398)

### 30.05.2020 
From today on, our paper "Multi-level Feature Fusion-based CNN for Local Climate Zone Classification from Sentinel-2 Images: Benchmark Results on the So2Sat LCZ42 Dataset" is available online via the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing. The contributions of this paper are several: First of all, we propose to standardize the experimental setup of local climate zone (LCZ) classification approaches using the So2Sat LCZ42 dataset with pre-defined data splits to ensure actual comparability of methods. Besides, we propose a simple and light-weith model, Sen2LCZ-Net, for LCZ mapping, which is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results while requiring less computational effort than standard network architectures. The paper can be accessed here: [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9103196)

### 20.03.2020
The IEEE-GRSS Data Fusion Contest 2020 on weakly supervised land cover mapping is over and turned out to be a great success! Far more than 100 international teams have dared to tackle the difficult challenge, and about 40 teams have entered the final phase. Eventually, the winning teams were able to significantly outperform the baseline (i.e. an average accuracy of about 40%): In Track 1 (land cover classification with only low-resolution labels), a consortium from Georgia Tech, Yale, USC and Microsoft Research achieved a stunning 57.49%, while in Track 2 (land cover classification with low-resolution and high-resolution labels) a team from Ohio State University managed to score 61.42%. Among the other top-performing teams, we had participants from Wuhan University, the German Aerospace Center, and Xidian University, showcasing the high international impact of the contest. More info on the contest results can be found [here](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/2020-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest-results/). 

### 19.03.2020
Today, our paper "A framework for large-scale mapping of human settlement extent from Sentinel-2 images via fully convolutional neural networks" was published by ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. It proposes a straightforward, simple, yet effective fully convolutional network-based architecture, called Sen2HSE, for the fully automatic mapping of the human settlement extent. The framework uses existing geodata as training labels and can be applied to extended geographic regions of interest. The paper can be found here: [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271620300344)

Today, our paper "Mapping the land cover of Africa at 10 m resolution from multi-source remote sensing data with Google Earth Engine" was published by MDPI Remote Sensing. We have used an land cover mapping scheme based on a simplified version of the local climate zone scheme to map the entire African continent in the cloud. The paper can be found here: [Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/4/602)

### 07.01.2020
Today, our paper "Fusing Multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 Imagery for Urban Land Cover Classification with Residual Convolutional Neural Networks" was published online by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters. It investigates different approaches for the fusion of cloud-free Sentinel-2 images acquired in different seasons and how this fusion can help to improve the final classification accuracy for local climate zone mapping. The paper can be found here: [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8951229)

Our research proposal „AI4Sentinels – Deep Learning for the Enrichment of Sentinel Satellite Images“ was accepted and will be funded by the German Federal Ministry for Econimic Affairs and Energy for three years, starting from 1 August 2019. In the project, we will develop image-to-image translation algorithms based on deep learning and SAR-optical data fusion, which mitigate the cloud cover problem in Sentinel-2 images.
