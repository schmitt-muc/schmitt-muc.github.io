### 11.02.2020
Today, our paper "Mapping the land cover of Africa at 10 m resolution from multi-source remote sensing data with Google Earth Engine" was published by MDPI Remote Sensing. We have used an land cover mapping scheme based on a simplified version of the local climate zone scheme to map the entire African continent in the cloud. The paper can be found here: [Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/4/602)

### 13.12.2019
Today, the IEEE-GRSS Data Fusion Contest 2020 has officially started. Its goal is to foster the development of machine learning methods for global land cover mapping from weak supervision and noisy samples. And the best thing is that it uses SEN12MS as training dataset! More info can be found on the [web page of the IEEE-GRSS](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/), or the [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/2020-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest), which hosts validation and test data. The corresponding article in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine can be found here: [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9028003) 

### 15.11.2019
The Thematic Session "Learning to Predict Land Cover from Bad Examples" proposed by Jan D. Wegner (ETHZ) and me for ISPRS Congress 2020 in Nice was accepted! If you are working on supervised learning methods that can deal with label noise or weak supervision, feel invited to submit a manuscript by 3 February 2020.

### 05.11.2019
Our latest paper "Matching of TerraSAR-X Derived Ground Control Points to Optical Image Patches Using Deep Learning" was finally published by ISPRS Journal of Photogrammety and Remote Sensing. The work is the result of a collaboration with Airbus Defense and Space and describes a deep learnig approach for SAR-optical image matching. The papre can be found here: [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271619302217)

### 20.09.2019
SEN12MS is now officially out! While our dataset, which is currently the largest available curated dataset for the development of machine learning and data fusion techniques in the remote sensing context, has already been out in the form of a pre-print since June 2019, today it was finally officially released through my oral presentation at the Munich Remote Sensing Symposium (MRSS). For more info, please see the following resources:

### 04.09.2019
Today, Hossein Bagheri defended his PhD thesis on „Fusion of Multi-sensor-derived Data for the 3D Reconstruction of Urban Scenes “ successfully. He was the first PhD student I have supervised from start to end, and it was my first time serving as reviewer in a PhD examination comittee.

### 27.06.2019
Our research proposal „AI4Sentinels – Deep Learning for the Enrichment of Sentinel Satellite Images“ was accepted and will be funded by the German Federal Ministry for Econimic Affairs and Energy for three years, starting from 1 August 2019. In the project, we will develop image-to-image translation algorithms based on deep learning and SAR-optical data fusion, which mitigate the cloud cover problem in Sentinel-2 images.
