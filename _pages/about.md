I am a senior researcher at [Signal Processing in Earth Observation (SiPEO)](https://www.sipeo.lrg.tum.de/), a joint venture of the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), and the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de). 
Besides, I serve as the deputy of the lab head, Prof. Xiaoxiang Zhu and was appointed as an Adjunct Teaching Professor at the [Department of Aerospace and Geodesy](https://www.lrg.tum.de) of TUM in March 2019.

Before joining SiPEO, I worked as interim Chair manager and deputy of the professor at the [Chair for Remote Sensing Technology](https://www.lmf.lrg.tum.de/) (Prof. Richard Bamler), also a TUM-DLR joint venture, and as scientific staff member at Prof. Uwe Stilla's [Professorship for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing](https://www.pf.lrg.tum.de/) at TUM. 

TUM is also the university which awarded me my master's-equivalent engineering degree ("Dipl.-Ing.") in Geodesy and Geoinformation, my PhD degree ("Dr.-Ing.") in Radar Remote Sensing, and my habilitation degree ("Dr.-Ing. habil.") in Data Fusion for Remote Sensing. This eductational background should also explain my passion for geodata and concepts such as parameter estimation, image understanding, accuracy, and robustness.

Currently, my research focuses mostly on deep learning for data fusion in remote sensing, which I consider to be a crucial field in the era of big (geospatial) data. 
In this context, my vision is to help advancing the classic geoinformation field to the modern and future-proof field of geospatial data science.
