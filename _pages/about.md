I am a full professor at the [Department of Geoinformatics](https://www.geo.hm.edu/) of [Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS)](https://www.hm.edu/). Due to my habilitation in 2018, I have also been an Adjunct Teaching Professor at the [Department of Aerospace and Geodesy](https://www.lrg.tum.de) of TUM since March 2019.  

Before joining MUAS, I was a senior researcher at [Signal Processing in Earth Observation (SiPEO)](https://www.sipeo.lrg.tum.de/), a joint venture of the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), and the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de). 
In summer 2016, I was a guest scientist at the [Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory](https://mirsl.ecs.umass.edu/) of the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/).

Before joining SiPEO, I worked as interim Chair manager and deputy of the professor at the [Chair for Remote Sensing Technology](https://www.lmf.lrg.tum.de/) (Prof. Richard Bamler), also a TUM-DLR joint venture, and as scientific staff member at Prof. Uwe Stilla's [Professorship for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing](https://www.pf.lrg.tum.de/) at TUM. 

My technical passion is in the fields of Earth observation and geospatial data science, i.e. I work on the extraction of geospatial information from different kinds of remote sensing data. For this purpose, I use techniques from fields such as signal/image processing, machine learning or data fusion.
