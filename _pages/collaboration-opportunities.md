## Open Jobs

## Students
If you are interested in doing your Bachelor's or Master's thesis under my supervision, no matter whether at Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS) or Technical University of Munich (TUM), please send me a message. I offer both internal project topics in line with my research agenda, as well as topics co-supervised by external partners (DLR, industry). Thematically, your interest should fall under the umbrella of methodical or applied remote sensing, geospatial data fusion, or geospatial data science.
